RSVPlus Web App

## Project Idea

RSVPlus is a Web App for finding the most optimal time slot when it comes to organizing events or meetups with friends. The current issue is that organizing meetups by manually asking around or through telegram polls could be a inefficient and chaotic experience for many.

RSVPlus aims to solve these issues with its own unique features. Users will have their own local calendar in which they can import their google calendar to. There will be channels in which host can create when organizing a meetup/event and users can join the channel.

Through a broadcast from the host which requests for users date availability (start date - end date), users will be prompted the option to sync their local calendar. Upon everyone's agreement, RSVPlus' algorithm will take everyone's calendar availability for the specified dates into consideration. After which, it determines the most optimal time slot and broadcast it to the group, should there not be a date, alternative suggestions will be provided.

## Purpose

Through this project, we aim to bring convenience and accessibility to everyone, such as friend groups, co-curricular activity groups or even project teams when it comes to organizing meetups. With an all-in-one integrated application and algorithm to suggest optimal timeslot(s) for everyone, it offers efficiency and connectivity when organizing meetups, while at the same time making the process much more simplified.
